### 🎯 **About Me**

With a strong foundation in accounting and finance, I'm now channeling my passion for data into the world of **data analytics and data science**. My unique background allows me to bridge the gap between raw numbers and actionable business insights.

I love exploring data to uncover trends, build intuitive visualizations, and create models that support data-driven decisions — all grounded in real-world business understanding.

Outside of data, I absolutely love **sushi**🍣🍥.I am great dancer might I add, can't say the same about my swimming😶. Currently **reading** "Outwitting the Devil" by Napoleon Hill(I am loving it BTW). All time favorite read has to be The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho❤️. I listen to house music 90% of the time, specifically Amapiano🎵💃. Currently on repeat  is a mix by a South Africa dj called KMAT, check it out:(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKEFx0aLSMk&list=RDlKEFx0aLSMk&start_radio=1&t=4637s). A new skill I am learning is roller skating, definitely not as easy as it looks😭.
